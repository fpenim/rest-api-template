# REST API Template

This is an initial template to build a clean REST API in Java with:
- [Spring 5](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/)
- [Jetty 9](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) (embedded)
- [Jackson converter](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)

Go ahead and clone/fork it if you find it useful.
